1. by using object literal syntax
2. New keywords

we call a function that's used specifically to construct an object

a function constructor. ==> a normalt function which is used to create an obejct 


New operator creates a new empty objct and then we can add on top of it using this .


function person() {
  console.log(this);
  this.firstname = "ayush";
  this.lastname = "joshi";

  console.log("properties are now added to this " + this.firstname);
}

var person1 = new person();

// here new keyword retrun an empty object
console.log(person1);

Difference between object created by string literal vs Constructor function in JavaScript

Objects created using object literal are singletons, this means when a change is made to the object, it affects the object entire the script.
Whereas if an object is created using constructor function and a change is made to it, that change won't affect the object throughout the script.
