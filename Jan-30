Javascript function can be passes to another functions and can be used as a variable.
Example : 
function log(a) {
  a();
}

log(function passingfunction(){
console.log("Passing function ran");
});
// output is Passing function ran

-------------------------------------------------

Pass by value - it works for primitives when a has value 3 and then b is passes as paramenter it will reference to the same value but a copy adresses are not same 

Pass by reference - it works in objects and function (special type of objects in javascript) if we set the values of references eqaulr it will point to the exact asmae memory location.
