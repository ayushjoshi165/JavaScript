Javascript function can be passes to another functions and can be used as a variable.
Example : 
function log(a) {
  a();
}

log(function passingfunction(){
console.log("Passing function ran");
});
// output is Passing function ran

-------------------------------------------------

Pass by value - it works for primitives when a has value 3 and then b is passes as paramenter it will reference to the same value but a copy adresses are not same 

Pass by reference - it works in objects and function (special type of objects in javascript) if we set the values of references eqaulr it will point to the exact asmae memory location.


// by value

var a = 3;

var b;

b = a; // creates a new spot in memory and copy the value
a = 2; // now both variables are on their own
console.log(a);
console.log(b);

// by referance (all objects (including functions ))

var c = { greeting: "hi" };

var d;

d = c;

c.greeting = "hello"; // mutated

console.log(d);
console.log(c);

// here both values are same unlike the above example as they both are referencing to the same memory location 


// lests pass it in function as objects

function changeGreetings(obj) {
  obj.greeting = "hola!";
}
changeGreetings(c);
console.log(d);
console.log(c);

*********************// equal operator sets a new memory location (new address) ****************

c = { greeting: "Howdy" };

console.log(d);
console.log(c);

// output wont cahnge both the objects as it is set to different memory location

//All primitive types are by value, and all objects are by reference.

Objects ,Functions and 'this'

when a function is invoked a new execution context is created.

Remember not to confuse this with the object that we've been discussing.

The object sitting in memory that is a function has properties and methods.

It has a name property and a code property where the code lives.

But when that code is invoked and

execution context is created and put on the execution stack.

And that determines how that code is Run, is executed.

So think of the execution context

as focusing on that code portion of that function object.

What happens when I run the code in that code property?
