Javascript function can be passes to another functions and can be used as a variable.
Example : 
function log(a) {
  a();
}

log(function passingfunction(){
console.log("Passing function ran");
});
// output is Passing function ran

-------------------------------------------------

Pass by value - it works for primitives when a has value 3 and then b is passes as paramenter it will reference to the same value but a copy adresses are not same 

Pass by reference - it works in objects and function (special type of objects in javascript) if we set the values of references eqaulr it will point to the exact asmae memory location.


// by value

var a = 3;

var b;

b = a; // creates a new spot in memory and copy the value
a = 2; // now both variables are on their own
console.log(a);
console.log(b);

// by referance (all objects (including functions ))

var c = { greeting: "hi" };

var d;

d = c;

c.greeting = "hello"; // mutated

console.log(d);
console.log(c);

// here both values are same unlike the above example as they both are referencing to the same memory location 


// lests pass it in function as objects

function changeGreetings(obj) {
  obj.greeting = "hola!";
}
changeGreetings(c);
console.log(d);
console.log(c);

*********************// equal operator sets a new memory location (new address) ****************

c = { greeting: "Howdy" };

console.log(d);
console.log(c);

// output wont cahnge both the objects as it is set to different memory location
