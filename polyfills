We can have some code that checks to see if the engine has a feature, and

if it doesn't we write some code that

does the same thing that that new feature would do in the newer browsers.

So I'm filling in the gaps where an older engine might not have

some features that the newer features do.

we saw an example where we checkked (!Object.create) then we added that functionality to it 


Function F(){}
F.prototype = o;
return new F();
