Closures : Function returns another function 


Greet is gone, the execution context is gone.

But what's in memory for that execution context isn't and the JavaScript

engine makes sure that my function can still go down the scope chain and find it.

Even though it's not even on the execution stack anymore.

And this way we say that the execution context has closed in its outer variables,

the variables that it would normally have reference to anyway.

Even though those execution contexts are gone.

And so this phenomenon, of it closing in all the variables

that it's supposed to have access to, is called a closure.
