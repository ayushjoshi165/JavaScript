Execution context , object provided by java script execution environment by default is this and window object
Global execution context.

accoscitivity of operators decides how wil it run.

how coversion is helpful in java script :

Boolean(undefined) => false
Boolean(null) => false
Boolean("") => false


var a;

if(a || a === 0)
{
// as 0 is coversed to false so we applied zero check seperately
console.log("Something is there")

}

here we used coversion to our own advantage to check weather the value of a is undefined, null or "".
if not then it will print otherwise not.

# Default Values 

function greet(name){
console.log('Hello' + name);
}

greet();

output is Hello undefined 

0 || 1 => returns the first true
null || "hello" => retuns hello


so in the above code 

function greet(name){

name = name || '<your nme here>'
console.log('Hello' + name);
}

greet('tony');
greet();
output is hello tony and hello <your name here>

remember about 0 it will coverse to zero as well .
 -----------------------------
 we created 2 files lib1 and lib2 and declare same name in both and then called it with the app.js to see which name it picks 
 To overcome that a libray override other library 
 
  var libraryName = "lib2"; // instead of this we did below code , this code prints lib2 

window.libraryName = window.libraryName || "Lib 2"; // but this will print lib1 because it will first check that any global variable with the same name is already there or not

-------------------------------------
Objects and functions 

How objects resides in computer memory ?

1. primitve "property"
2. object  "property" (as it may have another nested name vale pair) 
3. function "method" --> functions attache with an object is called as method not function so an object has a properties and methods.


var person = new Object();

// now we will add methods and properties

person["firstname"] = "Tony"; // it wil go ahead and create
person["lastname"] = "Alicia";

var firstnameproperty = "firstname";

console.log(person); // outputs an object
console.log(person[firstnameproperty]); // outputs Tony, using computed member access operator

// now we will see another

console.log(person.firstname); // output is Tony, using dot operator or member access operator
console.log(person.lastname); // output is Tony, using dot operator or member access operator

person.address = new Object(); // we have created new object named adress inside person object

person.address.street = "111 Main st. "; // adding prperty to the object
