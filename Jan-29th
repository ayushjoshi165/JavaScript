how coversion is helpful in java script :

Boolean(undefined) => false
Boolean(null) => false
Boolean("") => false


var a;

if(a || a === 0)
{
// as 0 is coversed to false so we applied zero check seperately
console.log("Something is there")

}

here we used coversion to our own advantage to check weather the value of a is undefined, null or "".
if not then it will print otherwise not.

# Default Values 

function greet(name){
console.log('Hello' + name);
}

greet();

output is Hello undefined 

0 || 1 => returns the first true
null || "hello" => retuns hello


so in the above code 

function greet(name){

name = name || '<your nme here>'
console.log('Hello' + name);
}

greet('tony');
greet();
output is hello tony and hello <your name here>

remember about 0 it will coverse to zero as well .
