Execution context , object provided by java script execution environment by default is this and window object
Global execution context.

accoscitivity of operators decides how wil it run.

how coversion is helpful in java script :

Boolean(undefined) => false
Boolean(null) => false
Boolean("") => false


var a;

if(a || a === 0)
{
// as 0 is coversed to false so we applied zero check seperately
console.log("Something is there")

}

here we used coversion to our own advantage to check weather the value of a is undefined, null or "".
if not then it will print otherwise not.

# Default Values 

function greet(name){
console.log('Hello' + name);
}

greet();

output is Hello undefined 

0 || 1 => returns the first true
null || "hello" => retuns hello


so in the above code 

function greet(name){

name = name || '<your nme here>'
console.log('Hello' + name);
}

greet('tony');
greet();
output is hello tony and hello <your name here>

remember about 0 it will coverse to zero as well .
 -----------------------------
 we created 2 files lib1 and lib2 and declare same name in both and then called it with the app.js to see which name it picks 
 To overcome that a libray override other library 
 
  var libraryName = "lib2"; // instead of this we did below code , this code prints lib2 

window.libraryName = window.libraryName || "Lib 2"; // but this will print lib1 because it will first check that any global variable with the same name is already there or not

-------------------------------------
Objects and functions 

How objects resides in computer memory ?

1. primitve "property"
2. object  "property" (as it may have another nested name vale pair) 
3. function "method" --> functions attache with an object is called as method not function so an object has a properties and methods.


var person = new Object();

// now we will add methods and properties

person["firstname"] = "Tony"; // it wil go ahead and create
person["lastname"] = "Alicia";

var firstnameproperty = "firstname";

console.log(person); // outputs an object
console.log(person[firstnameproperty]); // outputs Tony, using computed member access operator

// now we will see another

console.log(person.firstname); // output is Tony, using dot operator or member access operator
console.log(person.lastname); // output is Tony, using dot operator or member access operator

person.address = new Object(); // we have created new object named adress inside person object

person.address.street = "111 Main st. "; // adding prperty to the object

person.address = new Object();

person.address.street = "500 Race street";
person.address.apartment = "Mosiac";
person.address.city = "San jose";

console.log(person["address"]["city"]);

console.log(person);

// preffered approach is using dot operator

----------------------------------------------

Objects and objects literals

// pevious way of creating object is not ideal

// there is a short hand for this and that is object literals thst is {} it is same a new Object();

var person {}; // short hand to create an object

// I can also initialize object like above and add values in it like below

var person = {
  firstname: "Ayush",
  lastname: "Joshi",
  address : {
  city : 'San jose',
  state : 'California'
  }
};

console.log(person);

-----------------------------------------------------

Object literal 

we can use object literal sytax to create and manuplulate object by creating that string on the fly when the function is called.

when javascript engine sees curly braces inside the greet function at last he says you are creating object at the moment of execution.

var person = {
  firstname: "ayush",
  lastname: "j",
  address: {
    city: "San jose",
    state: "San jose",
  },
};

var person1 = {
  firstname: "Ramn",
  lastname: "j",
  address: {
    city: "San jose",
    state: "San jose",
  },
};

function greet(person) {
  console.log("Hello " + person.firstname);
}

greet(person);
greet(person1);

greet({
  firstname: "aj",
  lastname: "joshi",
}); // here we are passing string on the fly which will still work as expected

output is 
hello ayush
hello ramn
hello aj


And notice that I can mix and match this syntax.

I could take this variable Tony and add a new property using

the DOT operator instead of an object literal

and then use an object literal to define it as some sort of object.

So I'm mixing and matching my methodologies.


person.address1 = {
city : "san jose",
state : "california"
} 
// here above i am addind the adress1 object using dot operator 

----------------------------------------------
var greet = "Hello ";
var greet = "Hola! ";

console.log(greet); // it will override

// so we will use namespace as a container to it

var english = {};
var spanish = {};

english.greet = "Hello";
spanish.greet = "Hola!";

console.log(english.greet);
console.log(spanish.greet);

// now we can not do this

// english.greeting.greet = "Hello";
// because greeting is undefined and we can not create propert on undefined as it is not even an obejct

// to fix this i need to create a greeting object first

It's just keeping us separate from any other code,

any other objects sitting in the global namespace from the global object that

someone else might have written or even that we've written and forgotten about.

So, that's faking namespaces in JavaScript.
-------------------------------------------------

JSON - javascript object notation
It's inspired by object literal syntax in JavaScript and

so it's called JavaScript object notation.

And it looks an awful lot like object literal syntax.


when it says I parse JSON, it expects the properties to be wrapped in quotes.

So JSON is technically a subset of the object literal syntax.

Meaning that anything that is JSON valid

is also valid JavaScript object literal syntax.

But not all object literal syntax is valid JSON.


to convert JSON to javascript object literal  => JSON.parse('{"firstname": "ayush", "lastname" : "joshi"}')

to generate JSON string from object literal =>  JSON.stringify(objectLiteral);

--------------------------------------------------
 first class functions.
 
 in JavaScript, functions are what?

Ans : Objects. which means you can attache a property and method to it.
 
 functions in javascript has 2 parts  ==> 1. code
                                          2. Name
                                          
 --------------------------------------------------
 
 What is expression and statement
 
 Hoisting :   During the creation phase of the execution context,

the global execution context, in this case, it's put into memory.

And so it's available ahead of time.

greet();

function greet(){
console.log('hii');
}
-----------------------------

greety();

function greety() {
 
  console.log("hii");
  
}

anonomousfunction();

var anonomousfunction = function(){

    console.log("Ananomous function");
}

// here the upper half will be hoisted but lower from anonomous wont because it want get hoisted, and we can prove that by looking at execution context.
