how coversion is helpful in java script :

Boolean(undefined) => false
Boolean(null) => false
Boolean("") => false


var a;

if(a || a === 0){

console.log("Something is there")

}

here we used coversion to our own advantage to check weather the value of a is undefined, null or "".
if not then it will print otherwise not.
