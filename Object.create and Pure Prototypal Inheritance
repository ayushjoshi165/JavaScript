Object.create and Pure Prototypal Inheritance : 

You simply make objects and

then create new objects from them pointing to other objects as their prototype.

If you want to define a new object,

you create a new object that becomes the basis for all others.

And then you simply override, hide properties and

methods on those created objects by setting the values of those properties and

methods on the new objects themselves.

-----------------

var person = {
  firstname: "Default",

  lastnaem: "Default",

  greet: function () {
    return this.firstname + " " + this.lastnaem;
  },
};

var ayush = Object.create(person);
ayush.firstname = "ayush";
ayush.lastnaem = "joshi";
console.log(ayush);


above we created the object and set the properties to overwride the default values otherwise it will only output the default one
