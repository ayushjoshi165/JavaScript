In javascript we have function constructors 

ex : var a = new String() <== here we created a function constructor its not premitive 
now if we use prototype proprty

String here is not a primitve if has its own properties and methods 
try to type String in console and hit enter you will see 

String {'Ayuh'}
0
: 
"A"
1
: 
"y"
2
: 
"u"
3
: 
"h"
length
: 
4
[[Prototype]]
: 
String
[[PrimitiveValue]]
: 
"Ayuh"
-----
so the above is not a primitive its a Function constructor and gets its various properties from JS engine
