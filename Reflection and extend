Reflection is feature of javascript object to see itself and extend method of underscore.js is using that feature to extent the properties of other object onto the object we want

var person = {
  firstname: "ayush",
  lastname: "joshi",
  fullname: function () {
    console.log("Print fuull name" + this.firstname + " " + this.lastname);
  },
};

var person1 = {
  firstname: "kush",
  lastname: "joshi",
};

_.extend(person, person1); // extend is using reflection feature of objects and adding person1 or argumetns from index 1 onwards onto person 
// object and then we are are printing it below 
for (var prop in person) {
  console.log(prop + ": " + person[prop]);
}
