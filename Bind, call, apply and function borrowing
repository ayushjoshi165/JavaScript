var person = {
  firstname: "ayush",
  lastname: "joshi",
  fullname: function () {
    console.log("Print fuull name" + this.firstname + " " + this.lastname);
  },
};

var printName = function () {
  console.log(this.firstname + "  " + this.lastname);
}.bind(person);
// above we binded this reference to person object otherwise the execution context of this was global.
printName(); // one way to do that

var printNameAfterBind = printName.bind(person);
printNameAfterBind();

// above is the other way to do it.

------------------------

call

Unlike bind, which creates a copy of the function, call actually executes it.

And then just decides what the this variable should be and


-------------

Apply method 

apply method wants an array

of parameters, rather than just the normal list.

And that's the only difference between call and apply.

function borrowing 

var person2 = {
ar person = {
  firstname: "kush",
  lastname: "John"
}
console.log(person.printfullName.apply(person2));


this will print Kush John as we borrowed the function from person object and applied for person 2.

// here we are borrowing function from person object to apply to person 2 object .
