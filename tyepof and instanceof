This other keyword called instanceof, though, what it does,

it tells me if any object is down the prototype chain.

If anywhere down that whole prototype chain of going proto, to proto,

to proto, I find this type of object.

If I do then this first parameter is an instance of that one.

typeof : to determin the type ex type of [variable name]


typeof null is object whic his wiered
