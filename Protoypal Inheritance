The general idea of inheritance

is implemented differently in different languages.

But for our purposes we only need to understand the most basic concept.

That one object gets access to the properties and methods of another object.

We also know that the JavaScript engine adds hidden properties and methods to

things or properties and methods that we normally don't interact with directly.

All objects In JavaScript, and that includes functions.

All objects have a prototype property.

The property is simply a reference to another object, we'll call it proto.

It's an object that stands on its own, we could use it by itself if we wanted to.

But the object property that we'll call proto, that's it's prototype.
